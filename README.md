# ML-SVM-Binary-Classifier

This program utilizes scikit-learn's powerful arsenal of Support Vector Machine types to classify data over three seperate data sets of variying size and shape. See main .ipynb file for data visualization.

Files:
/data: three seperate datasets each divided into two classes.

main_SVM.ipynb: main file using python in a jupyter notebok for visualization. Uses scikit learn to implement a few different kernal types of a support vector machine in an attempt to classify each dataset.

To Run:

Since this is a jupyter notebook it is not necessary to run to see results as they can be viewed in github. However, if you'd like to run, simply clone the github repository and open the main file in jupyter notebook or jupyter labs.
